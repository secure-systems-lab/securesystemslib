# All runtime requirements including extras (see 'install_requires' and
# 'extras_require' in setup.py)
#
# This file together with 'pip-compile' is used to generate a pinned
# requirements file with all immediate and transitive dependencies.
#
# 'requirements-pinned.txt' is updated on GitHub with Dependabot, which
# triggers CI/CD builds to automatically test against updated dependencies.
#
# Below instructions can be used to re-generate 'requirements-pinned.txt', e.g.
# if:
# - requirements are added or removed from this file
# - Python version support is changed
# - CI/CD build breaks due to updates (e.g. transitive dependency conflicts)
#
# 1. Use this script to create a pinned requirements file for each Python
#    version
# ```
# for v in 2.7 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8; do
#   mkvirtualenv sslib-env-${v} -p python${v};
#   pip install pip-tools;
#   pip-compile --no-header -o requirements-${v}.txt requirements.txt;
#   deactivate;
#   rmvirtualenv sslib-env-${v};
# done;
#
# ```
# 2. Use this command to merge per-version files
#    `sort -o requirements-pinned.txt -u requirements-?.?.txt`
# 2. Manually add environment markers to requirements-pinned.txt
# 3. Use this command to remove per-version files
#    `rm requirements-?.?.txt`
