# Changelog

## securesystemslib v1.3.0

The `hash` module will be removed in the next major version. Consider using
`hashlib` from the standard library directly instead.

### Added
* Annotate library (#970)

### Changed
* Deprecate hash module (#977)
* Modernize license metadata (#942)

### Internals
* Refactor signing scheme parsing (#981)
* Misc test and ci/cd improvements (#926, #953, #958, #965, #966)

## securesystemslib v1.2.0

Small release with mostly internal changes.

Thanks to @L77H and @NicholasTanz for the bulk of the work on this release.

### Added
* ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 supported in signer API (#852)
* SigstoreSigner now has a convenience function for creating a signing
  identity for GitHub Actions workflow (#842)

### Internals
* Linting refactoring, switched to ruff
* Modern annotations used in most of the code base

## securesystemslib v1.1.0

This is a small release that only re-enables the use of SigstoreSigner.
Note that SigstoreSigner and SigstoreKey are still not part of the default
set of supported signers & keys but now they can be enabled.

### Changed
* SigstoreSigner: Re-enable compatibility with Sigstore (#781)

## securesystemslib v1.0.0

Securesystemslib API is now considered stable. The core functionality is
provided in the _Signer_ interface and the half a dozen integrated _Signer_
implementations that can be found in the `signer` module. Smaller helper
modules `dsse`, `formats`, `hash` and `storage` are also part of the API.
Several legacy modules have been removed.

## securesystemslib v0.31.0

## securesystemslib v0.30.0

This release contains improved Sigstore support.

### Changed

  improved UX where a new signing identity can be defined using
  interactive credentials (browser login):
  `SigstoreSigner.import_via_auth()`
* Documentation improvements

### Removed

* Python 3.7 is no longer supported

## securesystemslib v0.29.0

This release is reaping the rewards of the new signer API with four(!) new
signing methods: Two cloud based KMSs, post-quantum crypto support and a
"keyless" signing system.

Advance notice to folks using the `keys`, `ecdsa_keys`, `rsa_keys` and
`ed25519_keys` modules: these modules are headed for deprecation. Please have
a look at the `signer` API and get in touch if the functionality you need
isn't there (or if more documentation is needed).

### Added
* Sigstore as a new experimental signing method (#552)
* SPHINCS+ as a new experimental signing method (#568)

since then several of securesystemslib's direct and transitive dependencies
have stopped supporting Python 2.7. securesystemslib's major users, the Python

support for Python 2.7.

  Actions (#324)

  latest version of cryptography is no longer used on Python 2, as that is not
  supported.
* Updated Debian packaging metadata (#313 & #318)
* Improved messaging for issues automatically filed on upstream changes to our
  vendored ed25519 dependency (#317)
* Updated the ed25519 tracking script for upstream's branch name change (#331)

### Fixed

  as first positional argument (#288)
* `interface.import_{rsa,ed25519,ecdsa}_privatekey_from_file` do not error on
  empty password, but pass it on to lower level decryption routines (#288)
* `interface.import_ecdsa_privatekey_from_file` supports loading unencrypted
  private keys (#288)
* Revise `interface` and `gpg.functions` docstrings, and example snippets, and
  use Sphinx compatible Google Style docstring format (#288, #300)
* Linter-flagged cosmetic changes (#292, #295, #296)
* Bump dependencies: cryptography (#291, #293)
* Bump vendor copy of ed25519 (#299)

## securesystemslib v0.17.0

### Added
* Add `interface.import_publickeys_from_file()` convenience function (#278, #285)
* Add `gpg.export_pubkeys()` convenience function (#277)
* Add support to `hash` module for blake2b-256 algorithm (#283)

  and colorama (#284)
* Removed python-dateutil dependency (#268)
* Prepare Debian downstream releases (#198)
* Remove unused helper (`_prompt`) and global (`SUPPORTED_KEY_TYPES`) from

## securesystemslib v0.16.0

### Added
* Added new, self-explanatory, AnyNonEmptyString schema (#244)
* Separate functions for getting a file's length, `util.get_file_length()`, and
  a file's hashes, `util.get_file_hashes()`  (#259)

### Changed
* Improved documentation for abstract storage interface (#240)
* Change PATHS_SCHEMA to be any non-empty string (#244)
* Updated `keys.format_metadata_to_key()` to take an optional list of hashing
  algorithms rather than requiring users modify `settings.HASH_ALGORITHMS` to
  change this behaviour (#227)
* Rather than silently ignoring empty paths, throw an exception on empty file
  path in `storage.FileSystemBackend.create_folder` (#252)

### Fixed
* Proper tearing down of storage tests (#249)
* Handle empty directories in `util.ensure_parent_dir()` (#260)
* Fix tests to work with newer versions (3.0 or newer) of the cryptography
  module (#264)

## securesystemslib v0.15.0

* Allow Blake (blake2s and blake2b) hashing algorithms (#218)
* *new features*
  * Add nistp384 signature verification support (#228)
  * Allow callers to provide a default keyid in format_metadata_to_key, rather
    than using the default keyid value of a hash of the canonical JSON of the
	key metadata (#225)
  * Implement files and directories abstraction as an abstract base class;
    StorageBackendInterface, with a concrete implementation for local
	filesystems; FilesystemBackend  (#232). This enables users, such as tuf,
	to support non-local/non-traditional filesystems, so long as they provide
	an object implementing securesystemslib.storage.StorageBackendInterface.
	All functions which take a StorageBackendInterface default to creating a
	FilesystemBackend object for local filesystem interaction when an object
	isn't provided. This means that behaviour remains the same as in prior
	(0.14.x) releases of securesystemslib, only instead of throwing exceptions
	from the Python standard library a custom, generic, error is thrown:
	securesystemslib.exceptions.StorageError
* *removed features*

* Update developer dependencies (dev-requirements.txt):
  * cryptography 2.2.2 to 2.3.1
  * tox 3.0.0 to 3.2.1

## securesystemslib v0.11.2

* No (en|de)cryption of ed25519 key files when given empty password (pr #148).

* Support ed25519 crypto in pure python with default installation (pr #149).

* Update installation instructions to indicate commands needed to install
  optional dependencies for RSA and ECDSA support (pr #150).

* Edit setup.py's license classifier to `OSI LIcense :: MIT` (pr #151).

## securesystemslib v0.11.1

* Convert `\r\n` newline characters to `\n`, so that the same KEYID is
  generated for key data regardless of the newline style used (pr #146).

## securesystemslib v0.11.0

* Add `prompt` parameter to interface.import_rsa_privatekey_from_file() (pr #124).

  shown if the function prompts for a password.

* Add colorama dependency.  It is used to colorize some of the prompts.

* Update dependencies to their latest version.

* Support KEYID filenames for generated key files.  KEYID filenames are used
  if a filename is not specified.

* Minor edits to comments, indentation, whitespace, etc.

* Modify generate_rsa_key() so that leading and trailing newline characters
  are stripped before generating the KEYID.  This is done so that the
  KEYID generated from imported keys match. Imported PEM keys are
  stripped of any leading and trailing newline characters before the KEYID is
  generated.

## securesystemslib v0.10.8

* Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.3
